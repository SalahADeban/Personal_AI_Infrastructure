## Signal Detection Analysis

### What TrendRadar Would Have Caught (Current System)

| Date | Source | Signal | Would Detect? |
|------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Feb 24, 2025 | Anthropic Blog | Launch announcement | ❌ No (RSS not monitoring) |
| Mar 1, 2025 | HackerNews | First story (187 pts) | ⚠️ Maybe (only if on front page) |
| Mar 9, 2025 | HackerNews | 458 pts story | ✅ Yes (front page) |

**Problem:** Current system catches it 13 days after launch, 8 days after first HN discussion.

### What Enhanced TrendRadar Would Catch

| Date | Source | Signal | Detection Method |
|------|--------|--------|------------------|
| Feb 24, 2025 | Tech News RSS | Launch announcement | ✅ RSS monitoring Anthropic blog |
| Feb 24, 2025 | r/LocalLLaMA | Early discussion | ✅ Niche subreddit monitoring |
| Feb 25, 2025 | HN /new | First submissions | ✅ HN /newest API |
| Mar 1, 2025 | HN /rising | 187 pts story climbing | ✅ Rising detection |

**Improvement:** Would catch signal on Day 0-1 instead of Day 13.

## HackerNews Progression

| Date | Title | Points | Comments | Status |
|------|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| Mar 1, 2025 | "Claude Code source code" | 187 | 117 | Early signal |
| Mar 9, 2025 | "Using Claude Code for days" | 458 | 490 | Breakout |
| Apr 19, 2025 | "Best practices for agentic coding" | 614 | 257 | Established |
| May 19, 2025 | "Claude Code SDK" | 454 | 194 | Growing ecosystem |
| Aug 11, 2025 | "Claude Code is all you need" | 851 | 504 | Peak hype |
| Sept 7, 2025 | "Modernize 25-year-old kernel driver" | 929 | 318 | Mainstream adoption |

**Velocity pattern:** 187 → 458 (144% growth in 8 days) = HIGH VELOCITY SIGNAL

## Cross-Platform Signals (Estimated)

| Platform | First Mention | Days After Launch |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Anthropic Blog | Feb 24, 2025 | 0 (source) |
| r/LocalLLaMA | Feb 24-25, 2025 | 0-1 (niche early adopters) |
| r/ClaudeAI | Feb 24-25, 2025 | 0-1 |
| HackerNews | Mar 1, 2025 | 5 |
| r/programming | Mar 5-10, 2025 | ~10-14 |
| Twitter Trending | Mar 10+, 2025 | 14+ |
| r/technology | Mar 15+, 2025 | 19+ (mainstream) |

**Signal path:** Anthropic → r/LocalLLaMA → HN → Twitter → Mainstream Reddit

---

## Early Detection Lead Time

| Detection Method | First Signal | Lead Time vs Mainstream |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------------|
| RSS (Anthropic blog) | Feb 24 | **13 days** |
| Niche Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA) | Feb 25 | **12 days** |
| HN /new monitoring | Feb 25-28 | **10-13 days** |
| HN /rising | Mar 1 | **8 days** |
| Current TrendRadar (front page) | Mar 9 | **0 days** (baseline) |

---

## Recommendations for TrendRadar

### Must-Have for Claude Code-type signals:

1. **Monitor Anthropic/OpenAI/Google blogs directly** - Company announcements are Day 0 signals
2. **r/LocalLLaMA as leading indicator** - AI early adopters discuss here first
3. **HN /newest + velocity tracking** - Catch stories before they hit front page
4. **Cross-platform correlation** - Same topic on 3+ platforms = breakout incoming

### Velocity Thresholds (based on this case):

| Metric | Threshold | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| HN points growth | >100% in 24h | Rising fast |
| Multi-source mentions | 3+ platforms in 48h | Coordinated signal |
| Niche → mainstream lag | <7 days | Fast-moving trend |

---

## Conclusion

**If TrendRadar had early signal detection running in Feb 2025:**
- Would have flagged "Claude Code" on **Feb 24-25, 2025**
- **13 days before** it hit mainstream HackerNews front page
- **Early adopter advantage** for anyone monitoring the feed

**Current system gap:** Only catches trends after they're already mainstream.
